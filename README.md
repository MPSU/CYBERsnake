# CYBERsnake

Fully working example of running simple game on single cycle processor,
developed on [APS labs](https://github.com/MPSU/APS), though you can try it on
different platforms (see `platform` directory).

You can configure game through [config.h](../../game/inc/config.h).

To build game, one can run `make` from one of the platform subdirectory.
