# x86 CYBERsnake implementation

Right x86 implementation is WIP. Apparently, the idea of simply clearing and
redrawing entire map for every frame through cout didn't work out.
Code need's to be rewritten with [ncurse](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/announce.html) lib.

Run `make` from this directory to try current version.
